I recently reliazed that I can stream window screen, or game screen, with watermark on it and that several online service can stream screen with very low latency.
Meaning that if we provide remote control to a console or a computer, a company can make selected peopl play the game from a remote distance with low latency and be able to identify a leak and so make NDA contract with the play tester.

Why now and not before ?
Because OMI start to evolved and because two years ago a guy created uWindow that was the missing part.
