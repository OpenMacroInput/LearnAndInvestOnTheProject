Open Macro Input is design to be a realtime remapping software that manage macro and can use thrid app to mod the tool and create new testing tools.
In that way, it is less codable that AutoHotKey and less visual that ReWASD but it is hookable to both of them to help QA tester that want to script and automate their scenarios.

On of the key feature that is linked to my game developer profession is the ability to use Git to collaborate, share and switch from version to version while using the tool.

The goal of this year 2023-2024 is to learn if this hypothes.
