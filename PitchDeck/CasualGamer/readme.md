Open Macro Input is a software I created for me.
I am a game that compare the young people time on game can be consider as casual.
But for my part, I love playing with eSport player.

Open Macro Input allows me to reach this level by remapping the key mapping of the game and giving me some macro to avoid learning musculare memory requierd action in the game.
